        Addison Thomas is a 21-year-old multimedia artist with a passion for ceramic sculpture. Their artistic vision is
        deeply rooted in an appreciation for unsettling and grotesque aesthetics. They draw inspiration from the works
        of
        Kathleen Ryan, H.R. Giger, and Ronit Baranga, as well as the eerie atmospheres found in horror-themed video
        games like
        Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Addison primarily works with clay and various post-firing materials to create
        sculptures and sculptural tableware. Their work has been exhibited at venues including the Governor’s Mansion in
        2021,
        the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in the Epilogue Exhibition of 2023, and a collaborative showcase at
        Harding
        University in 2022.

        Addison is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in ceramics at UCA. Their work is centered on evoking a
        visceral
        emotional response—aiming to make viewers feel uncomfortable, unsettled, yet drawn in. They embrace the
        aesthetics of
        the goth subculture, using their art to express personal style while also honoring the broader creative
        expressions
        within their community. Clay is a limitless medium—one that enables the design of fashion accessories,
        tableware,
        sculpture, painting, and nearly anything else they are drawn to explore.
